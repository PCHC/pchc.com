This Notice of Privacy Practices (Notice) describes how your medical record will be used and your rights to access and control your medical information. When you established care at Penobscot Community Health Care (PCHC), you gave us your consent to treat you and to make a record of that care. Your medical record contains your symptoms, test results, diagnoses, treatment and a plan of care for any health service you receive at PCHC, including primary and preventive medical care, care management, mental health, physical therapy, speech therapy and audiology and dental care. This record also contains demographic information about you, such as your name, address, telephone number and family. We refer to this record as your medical information. In providing your consent to provide care to you, you also consented to PCHC making certain uses and disclosures of your medical information which are necessary to provide care to you, seek payment for the services you receive and support the legitimate health care operations of PCHC, which are described in this Notice. This Notice also describes the uses and disclosures of your medical information which are not covered by the consent you already provided and which you may be asked to authorize in the future and those uses and disclosures which are permitted or required by law. It also describes the rights you have concerning your own medical information. We are required by law to provide you with this Notice, and we are required to follow the terms of the Notice that is currently in effect. Please review this Notice carefully and let us know if you have any questions.
<h3>How We May Use And Disclose Your Medical Information</h3>
The following categories describe different ways we may use and disclose your medical information that do not require your authorization. The situations that require your written authorization are described in the next section. For each category, we say what we mean and give examples (note: not every use or disclosure is listed).
<ul>
	<li><strong>Treatment:</strong> We will use and release your medical information to provide, coordinate and manage your health care and related services. <strong>Your medical information will be contained in an electronic health record which may include information about your physical and mental health, HIV/AIDS, and substance abuse treatment, among other things. This record will be available to all providers, nurses, technicians and medical students or others involved in your care, even if those providers or staff are at different physical locations.</strong> For example, your medical information may help a PCHC physician at one location and a PCHC specialist at another location reach a diagnosis. This may include a licensed mental health provider, if applicable. PCHC providers may also speak with Care Managers to identify patients who may benefit from care management. Additionally, we may disclose your medical information to a family member or friend who is involved in your medical care, or to someone who helps pay for your care. Finally, we may also disclose your medical information to other health care providers for purposes related to your treatment.</li>
	<li><strong>Payment:</strong> We may use and disclose your medical information to get paid for the medical services and supplies we provide you. For example, your health plan or health insurance company may ask to see parts of your medical record before they will pay us for your treatment. Please let us know if you would rather pay for a procedure privately rather than have sensitive information sent to your insurance company.</li>
	<li><strong>Health Care Operations:</strong> We may use or disclose your medical information to make sure you are receiving quality care. These uses are needed to run our facilities and make sure that all patients receive quality care. For example, we may use your medical information to review our treatment and services and to evaluate our staff who is taking care of you. We may also combine medical information about many patients to decide what other services we should offer, what services may not be needed and whether certain treatments are effective. As a teaching health center, we may release information to providers, students and other staff for review and teaching lessons.</li>
	<li><strong>Treatment Alternatives, Appointment Reminders and Health-Related Benefits:</strong> In the course of providing treatment to you, we may use your medical information to inform you about possible treatment options or alternatives, or to tell you about health-related services available to you. For example, we may suggest care management services to you if you have a condition that would benefit from care management or if you have a history of avoidable emergency room visits or hospitalizations. We may also use and disclose your medical information to contact you and remind you of an upcoming appointment.</li>
	<li><strong>Fundraising:</strong> We are permitted to use your contact information and age (but not the details of your care) to raise funds for PCHC. For example, we may contact you to request a tax-deductible contribution to support important activities of PCHC. If you do not wish to be contacted for this purpose, please write to Penobscot Community Health Care, Attn: Development Department, 103 Maine Avenue, Bangor, Maine 04401.</li>
	<li><strong>Health Information Exchanges:</strong> We participate in a state-wide health information exchange (operated HealthInfoNet) with other providers and hospitals in the State of Maine. This exchange is a secure health information network which makes available certain limited health information that may be relevant to your care, such as allergies, prescription medications, laboratory test results, diagnostic study results, and medical and clinical conditions and diagnoses. For example, if you are hurt in a car accident and treated at a hospital that participates in HealthInfoNet, your care providers will have electronic access to certain information in your PCHC medical records. When your medical information is needed, ready access means better care for you. Mental health, substance abuse and HIV information is not shared with HealthInfoNet at this time and is not made available to other participants in the exchange. You may choose to not make your information available through the health information exchange by completing an ‚Äúopt-out‚Äù election form available at all points of registration within PCHC. In addition, you can go to the Internet at the web address of <a href="https://www.hinfonet.org/optout" target="_blank">https://www.hinfonet.org/optout</a> and electronically fill out the form for immediate action on your choice.

<h3>Uses and Disclosures Requiring Your Authorization</h3>
If we wish to use or disclose your medical information for a purpose that is not discussed in this Notice, we will seek your written permission. If you give your permission to PCHC, you can withdraw it at any time, unless we have already relied on your permission to use or disclose the information. If you ever would like to withdraw or revoke your written permission, please contact PCHC, Attn: Medical Records, P.O. Box 1599, Bangor ME 04401.

Certain laws provide greater protection about the following categories of information about you, including part of your medical information about mental health, substance abuse treatment and HIV/AIDS testing, diagnosis and treatment. <strong>These categories of information in your medical record are available to all PCHC providers, nurses, technicians and specialists involved in your care, even if they are located at different physical locations, as described above.</strong> These providers work as a team to provide the best possible care. These categories of information will only be released outside of PCHC as follows.
<ul>
	<li><strong>Mental Health:</strong> Information that you receive mental health services provided by a licensed mental health professional at PCHC will only be released to people you allow to have it by signing a written authorization form or as required by law or a court order.</li>
	<li><strong>Substance Abuse Disorder Situations:</strong> If you are a person with a substance abuse disorder and receive treatment in our Addictions Medicine Program, or at the Hope House Shelter, the confidentiality of those records is protected by Federal law and regulations. Generally, PCHC may not say to a person outside the Addictions Medicine Program or the Hope House Shelter that you attend either program or identify you as a patient in either program, unless (1) you consent in writing, (2) the disclosure is allowed by a court order, or (3) the disclosure is made to medical personnel in a medical emergency or to qualified personnel for research, audit or program evaluation. Federal law and regulations do not protect information about a crime committed by a patient at either program, about a crime committed against any person who works for either program or about any threat to commit such a crime. Federal law and regulations also do not protect any information about suspected child abuse or neglect from being reported under Maine law to appropriate authorities.</li>
	<li><strong>HIV and AIDS-Related Information:</strong> Information about you indicating that you have had an HIV-related test, have an HIV-related illness or AIDS, or have an HIV-related infection, as well as any information which could reasonably identify you as a person who has had a test or has HIV infection, will not be released to an external individual unless required by law or unless you have provided written authorization.</li>

<h3>Notice of changes to ACP Program</h3>
We‚Äôd like to let you know about changes in the Affordable Care Program. PCHC has worked tirelessly to lessen the impact of Medicaid cuts and the rising cost of health care. As part of that work the ACP Program will be changing its fee structure so it will be consistent with Federal requirements and will also be more in line with fees at other FQHC‚Äôs in Maine. The new fees will allow the program to remain sustainable, yet reasonable when considering the great value of the services provided. Please click on [wpfilebase tag=fileurl id=31 linktext='Affordable Care Program Fee Scale' /]¬†to view changes which are effective as of July 16th, 2012.
