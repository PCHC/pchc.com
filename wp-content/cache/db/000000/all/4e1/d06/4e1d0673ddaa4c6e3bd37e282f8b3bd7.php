Seaport Family Practice has been serving Waldo County for almost 30 years. It’s been a state and national leader in the transformation of health care. It has had mental health services integrated into its medical care for 20 years and has used electronic medical records for 12 years. It is a high quality practice, having earned the highest level of national NCQA Patient Centered Medical Home recognition – just like six other PCHC practices. SCHC has six physicians, a physician assistant and a pediatric nurse practitioner, and two licensed clinical social workers. There are about 22 employees in all and together they care for 7,000 patients. The practice provides primary medical care, integrated behavioral health and addiction services, Integrative Medicine, prenatal care &amp; deliveries; it also provides expanded weekend and evening hours, and group visits.

Seaport and PCHC have been working closely together for over three years to plan this development. Both share the same mission and vision – that everyone should have access to the high quality health care services they need regardless of their personal circumstances; and that the health care system needs to be transformed, through a robust Patient Centered Medical Home model, with a wide range of integrated primary care services.

PCHC and SCHC leaders are now focused on development of a new facility for Seaport’s providers and staff and expanding critically needed services for the people of Waldo County. David Loxterkamp, MD, Medical Director of SCHC said, “SCHC will continue to work with Waldo County General Hospital, other community organizations, and its patients, to offer the best possible medical care and attend to the non-medical determinants of health that make us a stronger and happier Waldo County.”

Ken Schmidt, President &amp; CEO of PCHC said, “We are deeply proud and honored to have the dedicated and caring providers and staff of Seaport as colleagues in PCHC.”";s:10:"post_title";s:45:"Seaport Family Practice of Belfast Joins PCHC";s:12:"post_excerpt";s:0:"";s:11:"post_status";s:7:"publish";s:14:"comment_status";s:6:"closed";s:11:"ping_status";s:4:"open";s:13:"post_password";s:0:"";s:9:"post_name";s:45:"seaport-family-practice-of-belfast-joins-pchc";s:7:"to_ping";s:0:"";s:6:"pinged";s:0:"";s:13:"post_modified";s:19:"2013-09-20 10:43:03";s:17:"post_modified_gmt";s:19:"2013-09-20 14:43:03";s:21:"post_content_filtered";s:0:"";s:11:"post_parent";s:1:"0";s:4:"guid";s:26:"http://www.pchc.com/?p=505";s:10:"menu_order";s:1:"0";s:9:"post_type";s:4:"post";s:14:"post_mime_type";s:0:"";s:13:"comment_count";s:1:"0";}i:2;O:8:"stdClass":23:{s:2:"ID";s:3:"520";s:11:"post_author";s:1:"5";s:9:"post_date";s:19:"2013-07-30 13:47:24";s:13:"post_date_gmt";s:19:"2013-07-30 17:47:24";s:12:"post_content";s:651:"PCHC has partnered with Electronics End, LLC, to offer the public a safe way to dispose of electronic waste.

The goal of the conference is to provide a forum to present current research, information and trends in health equity and the Affordable Care Act and engage key stakeholders in discussion.

"In order to ensure that the Affordable Care Act is implemented to help reduce health disparities and enhance health equity, people need to be educated about health care reform and its impact on vulnerable minority populations,” said Dr. Bankole.  "This conference is designed to help raise awareness for all stakeholders about service provision and the importance of culturally sensitive health care delivery. This is an important and timely topic given the implementation of the Affordable Care Act beginning in January, 2014.”

Conference highlights will include an opening keynote by Cara V. James, PhD, and John Auerbach, MBA, on “The Affordable Care Act &amp; Its Potential to Reduce Health Disparities;” a program overview of UNE’s CHANNELS project by Jennifer Morton, DNP, MPH, Leslie Brancato, MSW, and Shelley Cohen Konrad, PhD; presentations  on “Local, Population and Consumer Centered Care” by Joseph P. Ditre, Esq. and “Patient-Centered Primary Care” by Sarah Dubay, Med, MMEL; a luncheon keynote by Ann Lemire, MD on “Serving Vulnerable Populations” and a presentation by Pious A. Ali on “Youth and Health Equity.”

The University of New England is the lead partner and venue to host the 3rd Annual Maine Minority Health Conference due to its steadfast commitment to collaboration with community partners and engagement in community health initiatives as demonstrated through its Interprofessional Education, and cross-cultural health initiatives such as the CHANNELS project.

The Portland Public Health Division, part of the City's Health and Human Services Department, is composed of seven programs: Chronic Disease Prevention, Environmental Health and Safety, Family Health, Health Care for the Homeless, Health Equity and Research, India Street Clinical Services, and Operations.
