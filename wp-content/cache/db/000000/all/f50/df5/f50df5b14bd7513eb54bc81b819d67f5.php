Gorman Foundation for its â€œAt-Risk Geriatric In-Home Expansionâ€ Project. The purpose of the project is to increase PCHC's capacity to provide home-based primary care to patients age 65 or older who have one or more chronic conditions, such as diabetes, heart disease, congestive heart failure, end-stage renal disease, asthma, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), or cancer. The goal is to allow people to continue to live in their own homes and communities while maintaining their health and avoiding emergency department usage and hospitalization.

The grant will support the addition of a Medical Assistant which will nearly triple the number of at-risk older individuals the Community Care and Geriatrics Nurse Practitioner and Physician Assistant can provide in-home medical care for, as the MA will assist with more routine tasks currently performed by the providers, such as scheduling visits; preparing documentation and gathering data; making referrals post-visit; reconciling medication records; performing lab draws and injections; and providing education about community resources.

The grant will allow PCHC to put systems in place to see at least 70 patients in their homes, with the ultimate goal of offering the service to all of our high-risk geriatric patients. This is a much-needed service, and the demand will continue to increase. Projections indicate that by 2030, one in four residents of the state will be over 65; and Maine's State Plan on Aging states that "90% of older Mainers report wanting to remain in their homes and communities as they age." In addition to satisfying personal preferences, supporting people to age in place can result in lower healthcare costs, primarily from a decrease in avoidable hospitalizations and emergency department visits. At the same time, health outcomes improve because patients who lack the mobility or means to get to their providers' offices can still receive care.";s:10:"post_title";s:57:"PCHC Receives Grant for Home-based Geriatric Primary Care";s:12:"post_excerpt";s:0:"";s:11:"post_status";s:7:"publish";s:14:"comment_status";s:6:"closed";s:11:"ping_status";s:4:"open";s:13:"post_password";s:0:"";s:9:"post_name";s:57:"pchc-receives-grant-for-home-based-geriatric-primary-care";s:7:"to_ping";s:0:"";s:6:"pinged";s:0:"";s:13:"post_modified";s:19:"2013-09-19 16:39:39";s:17:"post_modified_gmt";s:19:"2013-09-19 20:39:39";s:21:"post_content_filtered";s:0:"";s:11:"post_parent";s:1:"0";s:4:"guid";s:26:"http://www.pchc.com/?p=474";s:10:"menu_order";s:1:"0";s:9:"post_type";s:4:"post";s:14:"post_mime_type";s:0:"";s:13:"comment_count";s:1:"0";}i:2;O:8:"stdClass":23:{s:2:"ID";s:3:"476";s:11:"post_author";s:1:"5";s:9:"post_date";s:19:"2013-09-10 16:39:58";s:13:"post_date_gmt";s:19:"2013-09-10 20:39:58";s:12:"post_content";s:1490:"Penobscot Community Health Care (PCHC) is pleased to announce that Hope House guests, staff, and volunteers have sustained a community garden for the third year.

In a 2010 journal article, Dr. A.J.

The effects of physical health and wellness have been beneficial to all aspects of our Clubhouse.â€

The components of the program include: Walking 4 Wellness, Intro to Exercise, Nutrition Assistance, Health Education, and YMCA Scholarship Support.
<ul>
	<li>Through Walk 4 Wellness, members and staff walk daily and track their mileage. Last month the clubhouse walked over 120 miles and have connected with 5 different clubhouses since they started in May.</li>
	<li>Various exercise classes are offered at Clubhouse in mornings and evenings to introduce members and staff to different types of exercise, such a hooping, ZumbaÂ®, yoga, and Tai Chi.</li>
	<li>Members are referred to local nutrition programs, offered trips to the Farmerâ€™s Markets and food pantries, and also tend and harvest garden items at the Community Garden.Â Healthy choices in the Clubhouse CafÃ© are also priced lower than â€œjunk foodâ€.</li>
	<li>Interested members are offered scholarship applications to the YMCA and supported in their independent workouts or participation in exercise programs.</li>

Â <b>Event Information</b>

<b>What:</b>Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  â€œPinesâ€ Clean Up

<b>When:</b>Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  October 25, 2013, 8:30 am

<b>Where:Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  </b>Volunteers will assemble at the Water Tower on Texas Avenue, Bangor.Â  General parking is available in a lot below the water tower.

Â Clean up of the â€œPinesâ€, a wooded area between Texas Avenue, Hammond Street and Interstate 95, is part of an on-going collaborative effort between the City of Bangor, Bangor Police Department, healthcare and social service organizations, and area homeless shelters to address public safety, the health and well-being of area citizens, and the quality of life in Bangor.

Â Bangor Mayor Nelson Durgin said "This year's Bangor recognition of Days of Caring takes on special meaning as volunteers throughout the community come together to clean up the "Pines".Â  The Pines has been used for decades by homeless persons as an area to "camp out", and the evidence of alcohol abuse, and other substance abuse in this area has created a very unwelcoming plot in our city.Â  With leadership of the Bangor Public Works, Bangor Public Health and Community Services, The Bangor Homeless Shelter, PCHC/Hope House and the United Way, volunteers will enter the area and dispose of many years accumulation of unsightly and unhealthy trash.Â  All are welcome to participate and other participants will include volunteers from St. Joseph Hospital, Maine DOT and Sam's Club who will donate food which will be prepared for lunch by volunteers from the Job Corps.Â  Clearly, this will be a day of caring where these volunteers will really make a difference.â€

Volunteers for the project are still needed!Â  Interested organizations or individuals may sign up at <a href="http://www.volunteermaine.org/">www.VolunteerMaine.org</a> or by calling the Bangor Area Homeless Shelter at (207)947-0092.Â  Volunteers are also welcome to meet at the Water Tower at 8:30 am on October 25.Â  General parking is available in a lot below the water tower.

Â Volunteers should dress for outdoor weather, wear sturdy footwear (boots suggested) and bring heavy work gloves.Â  Lunch will be provided for all volunteers.Â  Food and drinks donated by Samâ€™s Club will be prepared at the Hope House kitchen and served by Penobscot Job Corps Academy students.
